# Florida Evacuation Routes and Shelters Map

This project provides an interactive map visualizing evacuation routes, emergency shelters, and areas affected by coastal erosion in Florida. The goal is to help users assess risks and make informed decisions during emergencies, such as hurricanes or flooding.

## Project Overview

The **Florida Evacuation Routes and Shelters Map** is designed to provide critical geographic information for emergency preparedness in Florida. It features three main components:

- **Evacuation Routes**: Major evacuation routes in Florida.
- **Emergency Shelters**: Locations of emergency shelters in high-risk areas.
- **Coastal Erosion**: Regions of Florida impacted by coastal erosion.

Users can interact with the map to explore these layers and get a better understanding of the geographical risks they may face in the event of a natural disaster.

## Data Sources

This map utilizes several datasets to provide comprehensive information:

1. **Evacuation Routes**: GeoJSON data for evacuation routes in Florida.
2. **Risk Shelters**: GeoJSON data for shelters located in Floridaâ€™s coastal and flood-prone areas.
3. **Coastal Erosion**: GeoJSON data showing regions of coastal erosion that are vulnerable to rising sea levels.

## Technologies Used

- **Leaflet**: Open-source JavaScript library for creating interactive maps.
- **GeoJSON**: A format for encoding geographic data structures to display spatial data on the map.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
